You have created a blank project.
This is really a blank project! This is the only file.

You can add files to your project:
1. Right click on the project tree.
2. In the Project menu.
3. Create files on the command line. Click the "+" button in the Console panel to open a terminal window.

You can perform install software, use the included version control tools, or run scaffolders like `rails` (if your workspace has it installed).
You can change the project type in `Project > Configuration`.
